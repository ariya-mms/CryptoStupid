# CryptoStupid
A simple stupid encryption system for educational purposes.
This an educational project featured in [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org).

## Features:
 - Encrypting and decrypting of text strings through command line arguments and files by very simple algorithms.
 - The design pattern used in this project is Strategy Pattern to make it easier and more scalable when adding more algorithms in the future. 

## Future Plans:
 - [ ] Adding more (and better) encryption algorithms
 - [ ] Changing the design pattern from Strategy to Template Method
 - [ ] Adding support for more file formts to encrypt
 - [ ] Using some Kotlin to demonstrate the interoperability between Java and Kotlin
 - [ ] Making it more concise of errors and exceptions
